After this video, you should have an idea of what a front end dev and what a backend dev are</p>\n<p>Frontend development, a.k.a. client-side development is what you see on the web. These are things like the buttons, fonts, logos, and what happens on the screen as you interact with a webpage. Let’s say you go to the Apple website and look at the brand new iMac. As you scroll down you see how the monitor tilts and rotates, and how it changes its color. And you get to see and experience all the new features this new iMac has.</p>\n<p>Backend development, a.k.a server-side development is what’s going on behind the scene. Let’s go back to the Apple website. when you check out the brand new iMac, all the information you see on the website must be stored somewhere. This information is stored in the server, which is where the backend development comes in. Activities, like writing APIs and creating libraries. It mainly consists of things like data, algorithms, and pretty much works to make sure that everything in the front end works fine It is like an engine that gets a car moving.</p>\n<p>To help you understand this better. Let’s think of a restaurant. the front end is like the dining room. it’s the menu, chairs, the servers. the food that you eat and the wine that you drink. it is what you see, touch, and experience. it’s like the first impression.</p>\n<p>The backend is what you cannot see while you are enjoying your food. the kitchen, and cashier, and even the maintenance people who may not be recognized as much as the servers or the food itself. However, those who are not recognized must be doing their job for you to enjoy the food at the table</p>\n<p>There is also Full stack development, which does both. A fullstack developer is a software engineer who takes care of both the frontend and the backend. and I’m actually one of them. I am currently working as a Fullstack developer in South Korea. Starting from this, I am going to teach you some basics of programming to grab your attention, and if you are interested enough.</p>\n<p>If you need some visuals to understand this concept, please check out the YouTube video below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uNzX7z_-X4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2021//web/frontend-vs-backend","tagSlugs":["/tag/web/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-07-01T23:34:37.121Z","description":"What frontend and backend are and how they are different","tags":["Web"],"title":"Frontend vs Backend","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2021//web/frontend-vs-backend"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","288581551","401334301"]}
