TypeScript is developed by Microsoft, and you can use it with <code class=\"language-text\">React.js</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Redux</code>.</p>\n<p>Statically Typed Language has a steep learning curve since you have to consider the type of a variable when you declare it. However, it is more efficient if you are working on a pretty big project.</p>\n<p>Statically Typed Lanauge is more efficient, or more productive, because all the codes are linked with one another by type. Therefore, it is easy to move around related codes, which also makes refacrtoring easier.</p>\n<p>Statically Typed Langauge allows you to face erros during compile-time, which means that you can find your error as your codes become executable, before they start running. So you can find the error as you type your code.</p>\n<p>Check out the code below;</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> v1 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">123</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nv1 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"abc\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// throws an error</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The code above throws an error since ‘abc’ is not a number. This is the advantage of TypeScript as you find your error during compile-time.</p>\n<p>You can declare a variable with different type options like below as well;</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> v1<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">123</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nv1 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"abc\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the code above, <code class=\"language-text\">v1</code> is either a number or a string, so you can assign ‘abc’ to <code class=\"language-text\">v1</code>, and it will not throw an error</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/typescript/what-is-typescript","tagSlugs":["/tag/typescript/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-11-06T21:27:37.121Z","description":"Introducing TypeScript","tags":["TypeScript"],"title":"TypeScript - What Is TypeScript?","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/typescript/what-is-typescript"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","288581551","401334301"]}
