One bundle is made of many modules.</p>\n<p>Webpack is required since a single-page-application uses a single HTML file which consists of a lot of JavaScript files. Those modules are bundled into a bundle using webpack.</p>\n<p>you can found the full code on <a href=\"https://github.com/jasonkang14/babel_practice/tree/master/test-babel-custom-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">github</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Running Webpack\nWhen you run Webpack, a <code class=\"language-text\">dist</code> directory is created where a <code class=\"language-text\">main.js</code> bundle file is created. Below is the basic structure of the bundle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the entire bundle file is an IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)</li>\n<li>runtime code is what takes care of modules. If you use multiple <code class=\"language-text\">entry</code> files in <code class=\"language-text\">webpack.config.js</code>, a bundle file created by each <code class=\"language-text\">entry</code> file has a webpack runtime code.</li>\n<li>code that I wrote is used as a parameter of the IIFE</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using a Loader\nA loader is a function that takes a module as an imput and transforms it into a format that you desire. Image files, CSS files, CSV files, or any other files can be modules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are different types of loaders like <code class=\"language-text\">babel-loader</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">file-loader</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">style-loader</code> and so on. You have to choose the right type of loaders to deal with the file that you are trying to use.</li>\n<li>if you add an image file to a bundle, you can reduce the number of times that a browser requests for the file by using <code class=\"language-text\">url-loader</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">url-loader</code> provides a fallback option which allows other loaders to take care of the file if the file is smaller than its limit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using Plugins</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">html-webpack-plugin</code> is used to update the HTML file automatically when contents are updated.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">clean-webpack-plugin</code> cleans the <code class=\"language-text\">dist</code> directory each time webpack is ran.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">DefinePlugin</code> is used to replace strings in modules.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ProvidePlugin</code> automatically adds previously configured modules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/webpack/basics","tagSlugs":["/tag/webpack/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-10-21T21:27:37.121Z","description":"Webpack basics","tags":["Webpack"],"title":"Webpack - Basics","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/webpack/basics"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","288581551","401334301"]}
