If a valid candidate pair is selected, the controlling agent sends a STUN request with a flag that it will use this pair as the valid candidate pair. If the STUN request succeeds, the selected pair is nominated.</p>\n<p>In aggressive nomination, the controlling agent does the connectivity checks with the flag that this pair will be selected. If such connectivity checks succeeds, the pair is nominated.</p>\n<p>Aggressive nomination tends to be faster than regular nomination, but it gives less flexibility as it selects the pair which passes the connectivity checks with the flag as the nominated pair even if one of the other pairs could be a better option.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/webrtc/concluding-ice-via-nomination","tagSlugs":["/tag/webrtc/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-10T16:27:37.121Z","description":"Concluding ICE via nomination","tags":["WebRTC"],"title":"WebRTC[05] Concluding ICE via Nomination","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2019//posts/webrtc/concluding-ice-via-nomination"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","288581551","401334301"]}
