And you have probably recognized that <strong>HTML always comes first.</strong> So you can tell that it’s pretty important.</p>\n<p><strong>Firefox has released a website called MDN, which is formerly known as Mozilla Development Network. This website pretty much works like an official document for web development.</strong> MDN says that HTML is the code that is used <strong>to structure a web page and its content</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The keyword here is structure.</strong> It is a way to tell the browser “this is how this webpage is structured” or “this is what my webpage is going to look like, and what it’s supposed to do”</p>\n<p>When you learn new terminology, it’s usually helpful when you look at what it stands for. HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language.</strong> Let’s break this down.</p>\n<p><strong>HyperText is HYPER-text.</strong> Let’s think of the word “hyper.” hyper usually means extra-active or unusually energetic. but when the word hyper is used as a prefix, it means “above” or “beyond.” <strong>so hypertext, the word itself means “more than just text”</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Webster dictionary, hypertext is <strong>something that’s gone beyond the limitations of ordinary text.</strong> and many tech websites explain that hypertext is the text that links to other information. In our case, this information is another webpage. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages with one another.</p>\n<p>Next is <strong>markup. Markup is MARK-up. According to the Cambridge dictionary, a mark is a typical feature that allows you to recognize something.</strong> By marking up a webpage, you are annotating the contents of your webpage by using HTML elements. You are telling your browser that this is going to be a header, this is going to be a paragraph, this is going to be an image, this is going to be a button, and so on.</p>\n<p>And the last is language, which is a method of communication. So <strong>HTML is a way of communicating what a webpage looks like and how it is connected with another webpage</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a simple HTML element for an example,</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Code On<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;h1></code> → an opening tag<br/>\n<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;/h1></code> → a closing tag<br/>\n<code class=\"language-text\">Code On</code> → content</p>\n<p>and the whole thing is called an element. <strong>these tags tell the browser that the content of this element is going to be a header.</strong></p>\n<p>If you need some visuals to understand this concept, please check out this YouTube video below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBrl66Qe0II\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2021//html/what-is-html","tagSlugs":["/tag/html/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-23T23:34:37.121Z","description":"The role of HTML in web development","tags":["HTML"],"title":"What is HTML?","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2021//html/what-is-html"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","288581551","401334301"]}
